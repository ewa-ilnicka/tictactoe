## About The Project

  <img src="resources/view.png" alt="View">

There are many great tic tac toe games available on GitHub, however, I decided to write one on my own to improve my programming skills. I wrote it while watching tutorial on YT made by [Samuraj Programowania](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6wlzVp-5TD5xfDwiohSDeg).

In this project:
* structure was made in HTML, styling in CSS and the script in Java Script;
* I'm using BEM's naming convention (at least I tried);
* tools used: Visual Studio Code and Git.

I'm still learning, so there might be some mistakes.


### Built With
To built this project I used:
* [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)
* [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)
* [Java Script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)
